# AI Model Comparison for Text-Based Conversation using TOPSIS

## 📌 Overview
This project evaluates different AI models for text-based conversational tasks using **TOPSIS** (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). TOPSIS helps rank models based on multiple performance criteria, making it easier to choose the best one for conversational AI applications.

## 📌 Models Evaluated
We tested the following pre-trained models:

- **M1: facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill** - A compact version of BlenderBot optimized for dialogue generation.
- **M2: microsoft/DialoGPT** - A conversational model fine-tuned for human-like interactions.
- **M3: facebook/blenderbot-1B** - A larger version of BlenderBot designed for more complex conversations.

## 📌 Evaluation Criteria
We assessed model performance using the following key factors:

- ✅ **Response Coherence**: Measures how logically connected and contextually appropriate the responses are.
- ✅ **Response Diversity**: Evaluates the variety in generated responses to avoid repetition and enhance engagement.
- ✅ **Fluency**: Checks grammatical correctness and naturalness of responses.
- ✅ **Relevance**: Ensures that the responses align well with the given input.
- ✅ **Response Speed**: Measures the time taken to generate a response, crucial for real-time applications.
- ✅ **Engagement Score**: Determines how engaging and human-like the responses feel in a conversation.

## 📌 What is TOPSIS?
**TOPSIS** is a decision-making method used to rank models based on their scores across different evaluation criteria. It follows these steps:

1. Standardizing the scores.
2. Identifying the best and worst possible results.
3. Measuring each model’s closeness to the ideal result.
4. Ranking the models based on these measurements.

This approach ensures an **objective and fair comparison** of conversational AI models.

## 📌 Results
### 🏆 Best Model: **M2 (microsoft/DialoGPT)**
Based on the evaluation, **M2 (DialoGPT)** achieved the highest rank across multiple conversational tasks. It excelled in **response coherence, fluency, and engagement**, making it the most effective conversational AI model for various applications.

## 📌 Use Cases
**M2 (microsoft/DialoGPT)** is highly effective for:

- 💬 **Customer Support Chatbots**: Providing accurate and engaging responses to customer queries.
- 🏡 **Virtual Assistants**: Enhancing AI-driven personal assistants with natural conversations.
- 🤖 **Social Chatbots**: Improving casual interactions with users.
- 📚 **Educational Chatbots**: Assisting students with learning-related questions.
- 🏥 **Healthcare AI Assistants**: Offering basic guidance and support in medical applications.
